RECIPE 1: Apple-Cranberry Crostada
------------------------------------------------------------
Servings: 8
Yield: 6 to 8 - servings
Rating: 4.4/5
Category: /Desserts/Fruit Desserts/Apple Dessert Recipes/

INGREDIENTS:
• 3 tablespoons butter
• 2 pounds Granny Smith apples (or other firm
• crisp apples)
• peeled
• quartered
• cored and sliced 1/4-inch thick
• 1 pound Macintosh apples (or other soft-textured apples that fall apart when cooked)
• peeled
• quartered
• cored
• and sliced 1/4-inch thick
• ½ cup sugar
• ½ cup dried cranberries
• 1 sheet frozen puff pastry
• thawed but still cold (follow package directions)
• 1 egg white
• lightly beaten
• 1 tablespoon sugar
• 1 cup Optional: Ice cream or lightly sweetened whipped cream

DIRECTIONS:
1. Heat butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat
2. Add apples, 1/2 cup sugar and cranberries; cover and cook until apples release their liquid, about 5 minutes
3. Remove lid and continue to cook, stirring frequently, until soft apples fall apart and juices thicken to a thin-syrup consistency, about 5 minutes longer
4. Pour onto a large-lipped cookie sheet or jellyroll pan and cool to room temperature. (Can be refrigerated in an airtight container up to 5 days.) Adjust oven rack to low position and heat oven to 400 degrees
5. Open puff pastry sheet on a lightly floured work surface
6. Roll into a rectangle, about 10 by 16 inches
7. Transfer to a large cookie sheet. (I suggest lining the sheet with parchment paper; this ensures the crostada doesn't stick and allows easy cleanup.) Spread cooked apples over pastry, leaving a 2-inch border
8. Fold up pastry borders over apples
9. Unfold corners and form ruffled creases to keep dough from overlapping
10. Brush pastry border with egg white and sprinkle with the remaining 1 Tb. sugar
11. Bake until pastry is golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes
12. Serve warm or at room temperature with optional ice cream or whipped cream

2. Add apples, 1/2 cup sugar and cranberries; cover and cook until apples release their liquid, about 5 minutes
3. Remove lid and continue to cook, stirring frequently, until soft apples fall apart and juices thicken to a thin-syrup consistency, about 5 minutes longer
4. Pour onto a large-lipped cookie sheet or jellyroll pan and cool to room temperature. (Can be refrigerated in an airtight container up to 5 days.) Adjust oven rack to low position and heat oven to 400 degrees
5. Open puff pastry sheet on a lightly floured work surface
6. Roll into a rectangle, about 10 by 16 inches
7. Transfer to a large cookie sheet. (I suggest lining the sheet with parchment paper; this ensures the crostada doesn't stick and allows easy cleanup.) Spread cooked apples over pastry, leaving a 2-inch border
8. Fold up pastry borders over apples
9. Unfold corners and form ruffled creases to keep dough from overlapping
10. Brush pastry border with egg white and sprinkle with the remaining 1 Tb. sugar
11. Bake until pastry is golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes
12. Serve warm or at room temperature with optional ice cream or whipped cream

RECIPE 63: Apple-Cranberry Crostada
------------------------------------------------------------
Servings: 8
Yield: 6 to 8 - servings
Rating: 4.4/5
Category: /Desserts/Fruit Desserts/Apple Dessert Recipes/

INGREDIENTS:
• 3 tablespoons butter
• 2 pounds Granny Smith apples (or other firm
• crisp apples)
• peeled
• quartered
• cored and sliced 1/4-inch thick
• 1 pound Macintosh apples (or other soft-textured apples that fall apart when cooked)
• peeled
• quartered
• cored
• and sliced 1/4-inch thick
• ½ cup sugar
• ½ cup dried cranberries
• 1 sheet frozen puff pastry
• thawed but still cold (follow package directions)
• 1 egg white
• lightly beaten
• 1 tablespoon sugar
• 1 cup Optional: Ice cream or lightly sweetened whipped cream

DIRECTIONS:
1. Heat butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat
2. Add apples, 1/2 cup sugar and cranberries; cover and cook until apples release their liquid, about 5 minutes
3. Remove lid and continue to cook, stirring frequently, until soft apples fall apart and juices thicken to a thin-syrup consistency, about 5 minutes longer
4. Pour onto a large-lipped cookie sheet or jellyroll pan and cool to room temperature. (Can be refrigerated in an airtight container up to 5 days.) Adjust oven rack to low position and heat oven to 400 degrees
5. Open puff pastry sheet on a lightly floured work surface
6. Roll into a rectangle, about 10 by 16 inches
7. Transfer to a large cookie sheet. (I suggest lining the sheet with parchment paper; this ensures the crostada doesn't stick and allows easy cleanup.) Spread cooked apples over pastry, leaving a 2-inch border
8. Fold up pastry borders over apples
9. Unfold corners and form ruffled creases to keep dough from overlapping
10. Brush pastry border with egg white and sprinkle with the remaining 1 Tb. sugar
11. Bake until pastry is golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes

11. Place sliced apples into the bottom crust, forming a slight mound
12. Lay four pastry strips vertically and evenly spaced over apples, using longer strips in the center and shorter strips at the edges

Servings: 8
Yield: 6 to 8 - servings
Rating: 4.4/5
Category: /Desserts/Fruit Desserts/Apple Dessert Recipes/

INGREDIENTS:
• 3 tablespoons butter
• 2 pounds Granny Smith apples (or other firm
• crisp apples)
• peeled
• quartered
• cored and sliced 1/4-inch thick
• 1 pound Macintosh apples (or other soft-textured apples that fall apart when cooked)
• peeled
• quartered
• cored
• and sliced 1/4-inch thick

• ½ cup dried cranberries
• 1 sheet frozen puff pastry
• thawed but still cold (follow package directions)
• 1 egg white
• lightly beaten
• 1 tablespoon sugar
• 1 cup Optional: Ice cream or lightly sweetened whipped cream

DIRECTIONS:
1. Heat butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat
2. Add apples, 1/2 cup sugar and cranberries; cover and cook until apples release their liquid, about 5 minutes
3. Remove lid and continue to cook, stirring frequently, until soft apples fall apart and juices thicken to a thin-syrup consistency, about 5 minutes longer
4. Pour onto a large-lipped cookie sheet or jellyroll pan and cool to room temperature. (Can be refrigerated in an airtight container up to 5 days.) Adjust oven rack to low position and heat oven to 400 degrees
5. Open puff pastry sheet on a lightly floured work surface
6. Roll into a rectangle, about 10 by 16 inches

8. Fold up pastry borders over apples
9. Unfold corners and form ruffled creases to keep dough from overlapping
10. Brush pastry border with egg white and sprinkle with the remaining 1 Tb. sugar

INGREDIENTS:
• 1 (15 ounce) package ready-to-use refrigerated pie crust
• ⅛ teaspoon ground nutmeg
• ½ teaspoon ground ginger
• 2 tablespoons white sugar
• 5 firm pears
• 2 tablespoons good quality bourbon whiskey
• 4 tablespoons unsalted butter
• ⅔ cup white sugar
• 1 pinch salt

DIRECTIONS:
1. Remove refrigerated pie crust from package, and follow manufacturer's suggestions for unrolling crust
2. Combine nutmeg, ginger, and 2 tablespoons sugar in a small bowl
3. Peel, quarter, and core 4 pears
4. Slice each quarter into 3 slices, from core end to bottom, and place in a large bowl
5. Cut remaining pear in half; peel, and core one half and add to the bowl
6. Peel, core, and slice the other half as directed above and add to the bowl
7. Drizzle pears with bourbon and sprinkle with spice-sugar mix, tossing to evenly coat
8. Melt butter in a 9-inch cast-iron skillet over medium heat
9. Add 2/3 cup white sugar and salt to the melted butter, stirring to combine until mixture bubbles, 2 to 3 minutes
10. Place the single pear half in the center of the skillet
11. Fan remaining pear slices around the center, core end to the outside of the skillet and stem end toward the center
12. If possible, turn the pieces in the same direction
13. Keep adding pear slices, filling in any gaps, until they are all in the skillet
14. Reduce heat to medium-low
15. Cook, undisturbed, until pears are fork-tender and color develops to the liquid, about 20 minutes
16. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C)
17. Place a baking sheet on a rack in the lower third of the oven
18. Remove skillet from heat and place unbaked pie shell on top of the fruit, using a fork to tuck the edges of the pie shell toward the bottom of the skillet
19. Place skillet on the prepared baking sheet in the preheated oven
20. Reduce temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)
21. Bake until crust is brown, 28 to 30 minutes
22. Remove from oven
23. Place a heat-safe plate, larger than the skillet, upside down over the crust
24. Use oven mitts to grab the plate and skillet together and quickly flip the skillet contents onto the plate; this move is tricky and requires some forearm strength and dexterity
25. After the flip, if the contents are not centered on the plate, use a spatula to gently move to the center
26. Add any fruit that remained in the skillet, and drizzle any remaining liquid over the top of the tarte tatin
27. Allow to sit 15-20 minutes, then serve warm

Prep Time: 15 mins
Cook Time: 30 mins
Total Time: 1 hrs 45 mins
Rating: 4.3/5
Category: /Desserts/Pies/Tarts/Fruit Tart Recipes/

INGREDIENTS:
• ½ cup butter
• chilled
• ½ cup cream cheese
• 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
• 2 apples - peeled
• cored
• and thinly sliced
• 1 pear - peeled
• cored and sliced
• ¼ cup orange juice
• ⅓ cup brown sugar
• ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
• ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg
• ¼ teaspoon ground cardamom
• 1 ½ tablespoons cornstarch
• ½ cup apricot jam
• warmed

DIRECTIONS:
1. Cut the cold butter and cream cheese into the flour with a knife or pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. (This can also be done in a food processor: pulse the cold butter into the flour until the mixture resembles cornmeal; add the cream cheese and pulse until it's the size of small peas.) When you squeeze a handful of the mixture, it should form a ball
2. Shape the dough into a round disk, wrap it in plastic, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour
3. Toss the sliced apples and pear with the orange juice
4. Whisk together the brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, cardamom, and cornstarch
5. Toss the fruit with the sugar-spice mixture and set aside
6. Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C)
7. Set out an 8-inch tart pan, or, if you'll be making a free-form tart (galette), lightly grease a baking sheet
8. Roll the pastry out on a lightly floured work surface to form a 10-inch circle
9. Transfer the dough to the tart pan or baking sheet
10. Arrange the fruit decoratively in the tart pastry
11. If you're baking the tart on a baking sheet, leave a 2-inch rim of dough and fold it up over the edge of the fruit (the pastry folds will overlap)
12. Bake the tart in the preheated oven until the crust is browned and the filling is bubbly, about 30 minutes
13. Remove the tart from the oven and brush it with the apricot jam

DIRECTIONS:
1. In a large bowl, mix together the flour, sugar and salt
2. Using a box grater, grate the cold butter atop the flour mixture
3. Working quickly and using your hands, break the butter bits into the flour until they're evenly distributed and resemble the size of small peas
4. Add 4 tablespoons of water and mix
5. The mixture will be shaggy at this point
6. From here, add 1 tablespoon of water at a time until the dough comes together (generally about 3 additional tablespoons)
7. Flour a work surface and dump the dough onto it
8. Knead a few times until it comes together
9. Form dough into a disk

12. In a medium bowl, toss together the pear slices, brown sugar, cocoa powder, coffee grounds, vanilla extract and salt
13. Remove the disk of dough from the refrigerator and allow to come to room temperature for 10 minutes
14. Liberally flour a work surface and rolling pin
15. Begin to roll the dough to a 16-inch round, being sure to rotate it every so often to avoid sticking, Using the bottom of a bowl or plate that measures about 6 inches in diameter, cut out 3 circles

21. Meanwhile, preheat your oven to 400 degrees F
22. Lastly, brush the pie crust edges with the egg wash and sprinkle with turbinado sugar
23. Transfer to the oven to bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until the edges are golden brown
24. Check on the galettes periodically
25. If at any time the crusts' edges are getting too brown, take a piece of Reynolds Wrap® Aluminum Foil and tent over the edges
26. When the edges are golden brown, remove from the oven
27. Serve warm with a dollop of whipped cream or a scoop of your favorite vanilla ice cream

INGREDIENTS:
• 5 pounds fresh Damson or Damask plums
• 1 cup water
• 12 whole cardamom pods
• 4 cups white sugar
• ¼ teaspoon butter

DIRECTIONS:
1. In a sink full of cool water, rinse and de-stem the plums
2. Place them in a thick-bottomed pan suitable for slow cooking and deep enough to allow frothing when the plums begin to boil
3. Add the water and cardamom pods and bring the mixture to a low boil over medium heat
4. Turn heat to low for a slow simmer and allow the fruit to cook down uncovered for 1 1/2 hours
5. Allow the plums to cool
6. To pit the plums, strain the cooled plums with a colander, pressing the juice out with your hands and collecting it in a large bowl
7. Pick up the pit-and-fruit slurry in the colander by small handfuls and squeeze the plum pulp and skins gently into the bowl with the syrup, retaining the pits in the palm of your hand and then discarding them
8. Put the plums back into the original pot with the sugar and butter
9. Cook at a very low simmer until the mixture begins to thicken, about 4 hours
10. To test for adequate development of pectin, drop a spoonful of the jam on a plate and put it in the refrigerator for a few minutes: the mixture should be soft-set and no longer syrupy
11. Ladle the hot jam into hot, sterile jars, wipe the rims clean, place sterile lids on, and tighten the screw caps
12. Allow the jars to cool to room temperature and check to be sure that each jar has sealed

RECIPE 1084: Reshteh Polo (Persian Noodle Rice)
------------------------------------------------------------
Servings: 10
Yield: 10 servings
Prep Time: 35 mins
Cook Time: 1 hrs 10 mins
Total Time: 3 hrs 35 mins
Rating: 5.0/5
Category: /Side Dish/Rice Side Dish Recipes/

INGREDIENTS:
• 1 cup basmati rice
• 3 ½ tablespoons kosher salt
• divided
• ¼ teaspoon saffron threads
• 2 tablespoons boiling water
• ½ (8 ounce) package roasted noodles
• ¼ cup grapeseed oil
• kosher salt to taste (such as Diamond Crystal®)
• 2 medium gold potatoes
• sliced into quarter rounds
• ¼ cup boiling water
• 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
• melted
• 3 tablespoons unsalted butter
• 6 Medjool dates
• pitted and quartered
• ½ cup golden raisins
• rinsed and drained
• ¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon

DIRECTIONS:
1. Place rice in a medium bowl and cover with tepid water
2. Gently swish it around with your finger to activate the starches, then tip the bowl to drain water
3. Repeat this process until water runs clear, about 7 rinses
4. Cover rice with cold water, add 1/2 tablespoon salt, stir gently, and soak for 1 hour
5. Drain rice without rinsing
6. Crush saffron threads to a powder in a small mortar and pestle
7. Transfer to a small bowl with 2 tablespoons boiling water
8. Stir, cover, and set saffron water aside
9. Fill a 5-quart nonstick pot with 9 cups water and bring to a boil over medium-high heat
10. Add 3 tablespoons salt and stir until dissolved
11. Break roasted noodles into thirds and add to the boiling water with the rice
12. Stir once gently, and watch carefully as it cooks so water does not boil over
13. Taste water for salt and adjust accordingly
14. Cook until the first rice grain pops up to the surface
15. Set a timer for 4 minutes and cook, scooping off any foam from the surface, until the timer goes off
16. Test rice and continue to cook until tender on the outside but still firm to the bite on the inside, 6 to 8 minutes more
17. Drain rice and noodles in a colander and rinse quickly with lukewarm water and a spray faucet to rinse off extra starch
18. Taste and gently rinse again if too salty
19. Set aside to drain completely
20. Wash and dry the pot
21. Place the clean pot over medium heat
22. Add oil, 1 tablespoon saffron water, and a pinch of salt; swirl the pot until the bottom and lower sides are coated with the oil mixture
23. Tightly overlap potato slices in a single layer covering the bottom of the pot to create the tahdig layer
24. Gently scatter rice-noodle mixture over the tahdig in a pyramid shape, making sure potatoes are completely covered and moving noodles away from the sides of the pot
25. Gently poke the handle of a wooden spoon into the rice and noodles a few times, being careful not to hit the tahdig; this will allow steam to escape while cooking
26. Cover and cook until you see steam escaping from the sides of the lid and tahdig starts to set, about 10 minutes
27. Meanwhile, combine 1/4 cup boiling water with 2 tablespoons melted butter and remaining saffron water
28. Lay a kitchen towel out on a heatproof surface
29. Test the tahdig by quickly tapping the side of the pot with a wooden spoon
30. When the pot sizzles, remove it from the heat
31. Remove the lid and place it on the kitchen towel, being careful that none of the condensation drips into the pot
32. Wrap the towel around the lid and secure the ends at the top by the handle so they will not hang near the heat source
33. Drizzle the butter mixture over the rice and cover with the towel-wrapped lid
34. Place a heat diffuser on a burner over low or medium-low heat and return the pot to the stove
35. Cook until crispy, rotating the pot a few times, about 35 minutes
36. Remove from the heat and place on a damp kitchen towel; let sit, uncovered, for 5 minutes so tahdig will release easily
37. Meanwhile, melt 3 tablespoons butter in a small pan over medium heat
38. Add dates, raisins, and cinnamon; sprinkle with a little salt
39. Cook and stir until dates are glistening and soft, 3 to 5 minutes
40. Gently scatter rice on a platter and remove potato tahdig pieces and serve on the side
41. Sprinkle raisin-date sauce over top
